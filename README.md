In this project, I am building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to gather Twitter data and store it for further analysis. Here's a detailed description of the project and what I am achieving with this code:

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to extract tweets from a specific user account (in this case, @elonmusk), transform the data by cleaning and refining it, and load it into a storage system like AWS S3 or save it locally for further analysis. The pipeline is orchestrated using Apache Airflow for automation, scheduling, and management.

Key Components:
Twitter Data Extraction:

I use the Tweepy library to authenticate with the Twitter API, leveraging credentials like access_key, access_secret, consumer_key, and consumer_secret.
The pipeline extracts up to 200 tweets from the @elonmusk Twitter account, excluding retweets, and ensures that the full text of each tweet is captured.
Data Transformation:

The raw tweet data is refined to include only the relevant fields such as:
user: The username of the tweet author.
text: The content of the tweet.
favorite_count: The number of likes the tweet received.
retweet_count: The number of retweets.
created_at: The timestamp of the tweet.
The transformation step ensures that the data is organized and structured in a usable format (a Pandas DataFrame).
Data Loading:

The refined tweets are saved as a CSV file (refined_tweets.csv). In the production environment, this CSV could be uploaded to cloud storage such as AWS S3 for further analysis or reporting.
Airflow Integration:

I use Apache Airflow to automate the entire ETL process. A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is created with a task that triggers the run_twitter_etl() function daily (schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1)).
The task ensures that the pipeline runs at regular intervals, automatically fetching the latest tweets and updating the dataset.
Future Steps:

I can expand the project to analyze the collected tweets, such as performing sentiment analysis, tracking trends over time, or exploring engagement metrics (likes and retweets).
The ETL pipeline can also be modified to gather data from multiple Twitter accounts or hashtags, making it a versatile tool for social media analytics.
Conclusion:
This project allows me to build a fully automated ETL pipeline using Airflow to collect and refine real-time Twitter data. The refined data can then be used for deeper analysis, providing valuable insights into social media activity.
